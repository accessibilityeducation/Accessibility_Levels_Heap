     * right child of i.  If c[i] is not the root, then c[(i-1)/2] (using
     * integer division) is the parent of c[i].

     * Class Invariants:
     *
     *   The tree is complete:
     *     1. `c[0..c.size()-1]` are non-null
     *
     *   The tree satisfies the heap property:
     *     2. if `c[i]` has a parent, then `c[i]`'s parent's priority
     *        is smaller than `c[i]`'s priority
     *
     *   In Phase 3, the following class invariant also must be maintained:
     *     3. The tree cannot contain duplicate *values*; note that dupliate
     *        *priorities* are still allowed.
     *     4. map contains one entry for each element of the heap, so
     *        map.size() == c.size()
     *     5. For each value v in the heap, its map entry contains in the
     *        the index of v in c. Thus: map.get(c[i]) = i.
